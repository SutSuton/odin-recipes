  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>What makes a good brownie? Using both cocoa AND melted chocolate, and butter instead of oil. What makes the <strong>BEST chocolate brownies in the world?</strong> Adding in a generous amount of dark chocolate chunks. Fudgy, as gooey as you want, and very, very chocolatey, this homemade brownie recipe is incredibly easy, made in one bowl, and incredibly forgiving!</p>
  
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>14 tbsp unsalted butter </li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups dark chocolate chips</li>
      <li>1 cup (175g) brown sugar</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1/2 cup (75g) plain flour</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (30g) cocoa powder</li>
      <li>Pinch of salt</li>
      <li>6oz dark chocolate block/bar (optional)</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan forced).</li>
      <li>Spray a 20cm/8" square tin with oil and line with baking/parchment paper with overhang</li>
      <li>Place butter and chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl, microwave in 30 second bursts (takes me 1m 30 sec) until melted. Stir until smooth.</li>
      <li>Add sugar and vanilla, mix, then add eggs and mix well until smooth and molten.</li>
      <li>Add flour, cocoa and salt and stir until smooth. Stir in chopped chocolate, pour into pan.</li>
      <li>Bake 24 minutes for really gooey in the centre, 28 minutes for fudgey but still very moist (my favourie, shown in video & photos), 32 minutes for moist fudge-cake-like.</li>
      <li>If you didn't use the extra chocolate for stirring in, reduce cook time by 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Rest for 10 minutes before lifting out of the pan. Allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before cutting. Store in an airtight container for 4 days (bet they don't last that long!) or freeze for 3 months.</li>
    </ol>
